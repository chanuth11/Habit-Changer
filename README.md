# Rasberry Pi Habit Changer
 Have you ever felt like your habits are just never going to end? Well, I have. 
 
 I think one way to disrupt this routine behaviour is to disrupt it lol. 
 
 So the idea behind this alarm clock is that it will act as an alarm clock. The end. No, I am kidding, the principle behind this alarm clock is that there is no user input. It forces the user to manually enter their desired alarm time (mine is currently 6:00 am :((((( ) through the program. But more importantly, this application sends you an activity which is completely random every time for you to do every time the alarm goes off. This is either to do a random act such as eating a banana upside down or doing a random act of kindness such as eating a banana upside down with a friend. Oh, and every time you wake up, you get to hear Michael Scott yelling. I hope anyone finds any use in this. Peace.
